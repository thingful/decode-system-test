# decode-system-test

This repo will contain a docker-compose config linking together the components
developed for the DECODE IoT pilot, demonstrating how they can work together in
order to provide the proposed functionality.

Currently this repo only contains the datastore, but soon we will add the other
components being developed for evolution 1 of the system.
